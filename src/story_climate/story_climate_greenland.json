        "storyinfo": "In the ocean there are both colder and warmer currents where the blue color visualizes the colder currents in this visualization and red color indicates warmer currents. The arrows show the direction of the currents in the ocean. If the circulation of the currents would change there could be huge impacts on the climate. When the glaciers and ice sheets melt, the fresh water will enter the ocean. Because of this melt water there is a risk the ocean circulation will slow down or even stop. \n \n The air temperatures in the Arctic increase faster than anywhere else on Earth every year. The balance at Greenland is therefore disturbed since the amount of ice that melts is not equal to the amount that falls at the surface. Greenland is surrounded by warmer ocean water which also is a problem for the glacier to maintain. ",

Therefore, a lot of people's lives are affected by a sea-level rise since it plays a part in hazards from storms, flooding, and shoreline erosion.  The sea level is expected to rise 25 to 30 centimeters between 2020 and 2050 in the US. In other parts of the world, the sea level is presumed to rise even more, which could be 40 to 45 centimeters. \n\n If all the ice on Greenland would melt, the sea level would rise by 7 meters, and because Greenland is closer to the equator, the temperature is higher, and there is a bigger risk the ice will melt than at Antarctica. \n\n Below you can choose to see a visualization of what areas in the world that would be under sea level if it rises by 2, 4 and 6 meters.",
