        "storyinfo": "In the ocean there are both colder and warmer currents where the blue color visualizes the colder currents in this visualization and red color indicates warmer currents. The arrows show the direction of the currents in the ocean. If the circulation of the currents would change there could be huge impacts on the climate. When the glaciers and ice sheets melt, the fresh water will enter the ocean. Because of this melt water there is a risk the ocean circulation will slow down or even stop. \n \n The air temperatures in the Arctic increase faster than anywhere else on Earth every year. The balance at Greenland is therefore disturbed since the amount of ice that melts is not equal to the amount that falls at the surface. Greenland is surrounded by warmer ocean water which also is a problem for the glacier to maintain. ",
