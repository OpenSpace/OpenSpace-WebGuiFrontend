The arrows show the direction of the currents in the ocean. If the circulation of the currents would change there could be huge impacts on the climate. When the glaciers and ice sheets melt, the fresh water will enter the ocean. Because of this melt water there is a risk the ocean circulation will slow down or even stop.",

You may have thought that it was the warmer air temperature, which it is not. Antarctica is very cold! The air temperature has to rise a lot before the ice would start to melt on the continent. \n\n This data set shows how much loss of ice we have had in Antarctica since 2002.",
