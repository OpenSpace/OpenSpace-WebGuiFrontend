The arrows show a simplified model of the direction of the currents in the ocean. If the circulation of the currents would change there could be huge impacts on the climate. When the glaciers and ice sheets melt, freshwater will enter the ocean. Because of this meltwater, there is a risk that ocean circulation will slow down or even stop.",

That is nearly quadruple 51 billion tons, which was the annual ice loss between 1992 and 2001. \n\n The main reason for the ice loss is the currents that bring warmer water to the glaciers. You may have thought that it was the warmer air temperature, which it's not. Antarctica is very cold! The air temperature has to rise a lot before the ice melt on the continent would melt enough to make a big difference. \n\n This data set shows how much ice loss we have had in Antarctica since 2002 and is an observation from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites.",

Therefore, a lot of people's lives are affected by a sea-level rise since it plays a part in hazards from storms, flooding, and shoreline erosion. The sea level is expected to rise 25 to 30 centimeters between 2020 and 2050 in the US according to Rebecca Lindsey at Climate.gov. In other parts of the world, the sea level is presumed to rise even more, which could be 40 to 45 centimeters. \n\n According to Marshall Brain at howstuffworks 90 percent of the world's ice is located in Antarctica, and if all the ice on Antarctica melted the sea level would rise by about 61 meters. The sea level does not have to rise much at all though to make a big impact on the world and the people. \n\n Below you can choose to see a visualization of what areas in the world that would be under sea level if it rises by 2, 4 and 6 meters.",
